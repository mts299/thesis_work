In certain applications a single local optimal value will not be satisfying to most difficult problems, to do better a global search for a global to find a potential optimal solution is required. However, simplying looking for a solution on a global scale is not simple, in the context of combinatorial problems, global optimzations are NP-hard problems. Making it a challenge to find a single optimal solution or all feasible solutions in a single to multiple search space. To aid in finding
a solution quickly and robostly, software appraoches can be applied to a global solver to aid in helping it solve the problem. 

One piece of software used in aiding global solvers is distributed system send out function evaluations to multiple machines, this grants a form of parallelism to the solver, to evaluate multiple long calculations in period of one evalutions. One praticular software used with pythOPT, python enviroment for problem solving, is Computefarm, this software utilizes the server-client model to distribute function evaluations to farmed computers. By doing this a form of parallelism is created and
decreases the time spent on each iteration of the solver. By applying this method to global solvers, like Particle Swarm Optimization,  applications for example crystal prediction was optimized N times faster, where N is number of computers farmed by the software. The reason this application benefits from computefarm is that the objective function can take over ten minutes to determine the total energy of a crystal structure using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package software.

Another software approach is implement a  database to monitor the simulation and keep backups of the solver status at each several iterations, known as checkpointing. Though is commonly thought of method to apply to a solver in case of computer or solver failure, it is difficult to implement because external dependencies. However, because of the flexibility of pythOPT development a simple checkpointing schema is implemented to store values for monitoring purposes and solver
statuses for robustness in case of failure. This becomes heavily desired when a specific result is known but the problem is difficult and convergence is not obtained quickly. One example is the qunatum error correction application, because of the desired fidelity value desired in simulated circuit the optimization can be long and difficult to find a single feasible point. Finding a feasible solution can take weeks to months for various variations, because of this unkown length of time to
solve a database is implemented in to the global solver to sore evaluations for monitoring the solver and in case simulations are stopped then a restart can be done.
