\section{Conclusion}

The four qubit system is seen as a system to encode code words in quantum computer, however the larger qubit system increase docherence. Because of the increase decoherence the system is not fault tolerant, to make the system fault tolerant a error correction gate needs to be applied to the system. The gate itself has specific constants that need to be optimized to correct the error to a reasonable fidelity that is $99.99\%$. This is done by treating the four qubit system
as a feasibility problem that needs to satisfy the condition Equation~\ref{} in the optimization. By applying this scheme in MATLABs global search solver, we obtained a solution for various gate processing times (Table~\ref{results1}) with $60$ nanoseconds being the current lowest gate time. Currently we are also looking at lower times shown in Table~\ref{results2} to obtain the minimal gate time for the four qubit system.
