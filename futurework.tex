\section{Future work}

With this new scheme of optimizing the qubit system, further work is being done to minimize the gate time. Efforts are also being made to reformulate the objective function to consider the gate processing time, currently set as a parameter before the optimization. 

Another system to solve is the five qubit system; by solving this system the four qubit system can be used for encoding purposes in quantum computers and the five qubit system will decode the message. This can lead into using quantum computers for security for the main computer calculations and even for internet purposes.
