The standard PSO and the new model (SEPSO) are compared w.r.t. performance on well-studied benchmark problems. We show that the SEPSO indeed managed to keep diversity in the search space and yielded superior results},

abstract = {A single-shot Toffoli, or controlled-controlled-not, gate is desirable for classical and quantum information processing. The Toffoli gate alone is universal for reversible computing and, accompanied by the Hadamard gate, forms a universal gate set for quantum computing. The Toffoli gate is also a key ingredient for (nontopological) quantum error correction. Currently Toffoli gates are achieved by decomposing into sequentially implemented single- and two-qubit gates, which require much longer times and yields lower overall fidelities compared to a single-shot implementation. We develop a quantum-control procedure to construct a single-shot Toffoli gate for three nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting transmon systems such that the fidelity is $99.9\%$ and is as fast as an entangling two-qubit gate under the same realistic conditions. The gate is achieved by a nongreedy quantum control procedure using our enhanced version of the differential evolution algorithm.},

The work should enable professionals to apply optimization theory and algorithms to their own particular practical fields of interest, be it engineering, physics, chemistry, or business economics. Most importantly, for the first time in a relatively brief and introductory work, due attention is paid to the difficulties '" such as noise, discontinuities, expense of function evaluations, and the existence of multiple minima '" that often unnecessarily inhibit the use of gradient-based methods. In a separate chapter on new gradient-based methods developed by the author and his coworkers, it is shown how these difficulties may be overcome without losing the desirable features of classical gradient-based methods.},

abstract = {Structural polymorphism in dense carbon dioxide (CO2) has attracted significant attention in high-pressure physics and chemistry for the past two decades. Here, we have performed high-pressure experiments and first-principles theoretical calculations to investigate the stability, structure, and dynamical properties of dense CO2 We found evidence that CO2-V with the 4-coordinated extended structure can be quenched to ambient pressure below 200 K-the melting temperature of CO2-I. CO2-V is a fully coordinated structure formed from a molecular solid at high pressure and recovered at ambient pressure. Apart from confirming the metastability of CO2-V (I-42d) at ambient pressure at low temperature, results of ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics (MD) simulations provided insights into the transformation processes and structural relationship from the molecular to the extended phases. In addition, the simulation also predicted a phase V'(Pna21) in the stability region of CO2-V with a diffraction pattern similar to that previously assigned to the CO2-V (P212121) structure. Both CO2-V and -V' are predicted to be recoverable and hard with a Vicker hardness of ∼20 GPa. Significantly, MD simulations found that the CO2 in phase IV exhibits large-amplitude bending motions at finite temperatures and high pressures. This finding helps to explain the discrepancy between earlier predicted static structures and experiments. MD simulations clearly indicate temperature effects are critical to understanding the high-pressure behaviors of dense CO2 structures-highlighting the significance of chemical kinetics associated with the transformations.},

@article{Boyd2004,
abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57{\%}, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t We have developed a software package CALYPSO (Crystal structure AnaLYsis by Particle Swarm Optimization) to predict the energetically stable/metastable crystal structures of materials at given chemical compositions and external conditions (e.g., pressure). The CALYPSO method is based on several major techniques (e.g. particleswarm optimization algorithm, symmetry constraints on structural generation, bond characterization matrix on elimination of similar structures, partial random structures per generation on enhancing structural diversity, and penalty function, etc.) for global structural minimization from scratch. All of these techniques have been demonstrated to be critical to the prediction of global stable structure. We have implemented these techniques into the CALYPSO code. Testing of the code on many known and unknown systems shows high efficiency and the highly successful rate of this CALYPSO method [Y. Wang, J. Lv, L. Zhu, Y. Ma, Phys. Rev. B 82 (2010) 094116] [29].

abstract = {An efficient algorithm named Pattern search (PS) has been used widely in various scientific and engineering fields. However, even though the global convergence of PS has been proved, it does not perform well on more complex and higher dimension problems nowadays. In order to improve the efficiency of PS and obtain a more powerful algorithm for global optimization, a new algorithm named Free Pattern Search (FPS) based on PS and Free Search (FS) is proposed in this paper. FPS inherits the global search from FS and the local search from PS. Two operators have been designed for accelerating the convergence speed and keeping the diversity of population. The acceleration operator inspired by FS uses a self-regular management to classify the population into two groups and accelerates all individuals in the first group, while the throw operator is designed to avoid the reduplicative search of population and keep the diversity. In order to verify the performance of FPS, two famous benchmark instances are conducted for the comparisons between FPS with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) variants and Differential Evolution (DE) variants. The results show that FPS obtains better solutions and achieves the higher convergence speed than other algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Based on formulations originally proposed in the 1960s for combining decision rules and problem constraints, these methods use strategies for combining solution vectors that have proved effective for scheduling, routing, financial product design, neural network training, optimizing simulation and a variety of other problem areas. These approaches can be implemented in multiple ways, and offer numerous alternatives for exploiting their basic ideas. We identify a template for scatter search and path relinking methods that provides a convenient and "user friendly" basis for their implementation. The overall design can be summarized by a small number of key steps, leading to versions of scatter search and path relinking that are fully specified upon providing a handful of subroutines. Illustrative forms of these subroutines are described that make it possible to create methods for a wide range of optimization problems.},

Both the tightness of the spectral bounds and the computational effort of the three methods, which apply to C2 functions $\phi$:ℝn → ℝ that can be written as codelists, are assessed. Specifically, we compare eigenvalue bounds obtained with the interval variant of Gershgorin's circle criterion (Adjiman et al. in Comput Chem Eng 22(9):1137-1158, 1998; Gershgorin in Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. fizmat. 6:749-754, 1931), Hertz (IEEE Trans Autom Control 37:532-535, 1992) and Rohn's (SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl 15(1):175-184, 1994) method for tight bounds of interval matrices, and a recently proposed Hessian matrix eigenvalue arithmetic (M{\"{o}}nnigmann in SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 32(4): 1351-1366, 2011), which deliberately avoids the computation of interval Hessians. The eigenvalue arithmetic provides tighter, as tight, and less tight bounds than the interval variant of Gershgorin's circle criterion in about 15, 61, and 24 {\%} of the examples, respectively. Hertz and Rohn's method results in bounds that are always as tight as or tighter than those from Gershgorin's circle criterion, and as tight as or tighter than those from the eigenvalue arithmetic in 96 {\%} of the cases. In 4 {\%} of the examples, the eigenvalue arithmetic results in tighter bounds than Hertz and Rohn's method. This result is surprising, since Hertz and Rohn's method provides tight bounds for interval matrices. The eigenvalue arithmetic provides tighter bounds in these cases, since it is not based on interval matrices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The resultant circuit is a randomly chosen extreme-channel circuit whose run-time is logarithmic with respect to the error tolerance and quadratic with respect to Hilbert space dimension, which requires only a single ancillary qudit plus one classical dit.},

abstract = {A possible building block for a scalable quantum computer has recently been demonstrated [Mariantoni et al., Science 334 61 (2011)]. This architecture consists of superconducting qubits capacitively coupled both to individual memory resonators as well as a common bus. In this work we study a natural primitive entangling gate for this and related resonator-based architectures, which consists of a controlled-$\sigma$z (cz) operation between a qubit and the bus. The cz gate is implemented with the aid of the noncomputational qubit |2〉 state [Strauch et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 167005 (2003)]. Assuming phase or transmon qubits with 300 MHz anharmonicity, we show that by using only low frequency qubit-bias control it is possible to implement the qubit-bus cz gate with $99.9\%$ ($99.99\%$) fidelity in about 17 ns (23 ns) with a realistic two-parameter pulse profile, plus two auxiliary z rotations. The fidelity measure we refer to here is a state-averaged intrinsic process fidelity, which does not include any effects of noise or decoherence. These results apply to a multiqubit device that includes strongly coupled memory resonators. We investigate the performance of the qubit-bus cz gate as a function of qubit anharmonicity, identify the dominant intrinsic error mechanism and derive an associated fidelity estimator, quantify the pulse shape sensitivity and precision requirements, simulate qubit-qubit cz gates that are mediated by the bus resonator, and also attempt a global optimization of system parameters including resonator frequencies and couplings. Our results are relevant for a wide range of superconducting hardware designs that incorporate resonators and suggest that it should be possible to demonstrate a $99.9\%$ cz gate with existing transmon qubits, which would constitute an important step towards the development of an error-corrected superconducting quantum computer.},

We demonstrate the failure of greedy algorithms to realize two fast quantum computing gates: a qutrit phase gate and a controlled-not gate. Then we show that our evolutionary algorithm circumvents the trap to deliver effective quantum control in both instances. Even when greedy algorithms succeed, our evolutionary algorithm delivers a superior control procedure because less time resolution is required for the control sequence.},

abstract = {The propagation of grassland fires is simulated using a fully physical based model, partially developed during the FIRESTAR European Union programme. This approach, based on a multiphase formulation, includes the calculation of the degradation of the vegetation (by dehydration and pyrolysis) and the turbulent/reactive flow resulting from the mixing between the ambient gas (wind flow) and the pyrolizate. The solid fuel is simulated as homogeneous distribution of solid particles forming a porous media, interacting with the gas flow using a continuous distribution of drag forces. Other source terms representing the interactions between the vegetation and the gas flow are also taken into account, such as the production of water vapour and gaseous fuel, the radiation of soot particles and ashes, and the convective exchange in the energy balance. The model was validated from preliminary calculations carried out at small scale, for a homogeneous fuel bed (pine needles, excelsior, sticks) and compared with experimental results obtained in a wind tunnel. Calculations are then extended to study the propagation of fires through a flat grassland, for various wind speed conditions. The numerical results are compared to empirical and semi-empirical predictions obtained in similar conditions.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for finding the global minimum of a multivariate function subject to simple bounds. The algorithm is a modification of the standard Lipschitzian approach that eliminates the need to specify a Lipschitz constant. This is done by carrying out simultaneous searches using all possible constants from zero to infinity. On nine standard test functions, the new algorithm converges in fewer function evaluations than most competing methods. The motivation for the new algorithm stems from a different way of looking at the Lipschitz constant. In particular, the Lipschitz constant is viewed as a weighting parameter that indicates how much emphasis to place on global versus local search. In standard Lipschitzian methods, this constant is usually large because it must equal or exceed the maximum rate of change of the objective function. As a result, these methods place a high emphasis on global search and exhibit slow convergence. In contrast, the new algorithm carries out simultaneous searches using all possible constants, and therefore operates at both the global and local level. Once the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence of the optimum, the local part of the algorithm quickly and automatically exploits it. This accounts for the fast convergence of the new algorithm on the test functions.},

abstract = {This reprint of the 1969 book of the same name is a concise, rigorous, yet accessible, account of the fundamentals of constrained optimization theory. Many problems arising in diverse fields such as machine learning, medicine, chemical engineering, structural design, and airline scheduling can be reduced to a constrained optimization problem. This book provides readers with the fundamentals needed to study and solve such problems. Beginning with a chapter on linear inequalities and theorems of the alternative, basics of convex sets and separation theorems are then derived based on these theorems. This is followed by a chapter on convex functions that includes theorems of the alternative for such functions. These results are used in obtaining the saddlepoint optimality conditions of nonlinear programming without differentiability assumptions. Properties of differentiable convex functions are derived and then used in two key chapters of the book, one on optimality conditions for differentiable nonlinear programs and one on duality in nonlinear programming. Generalizations of convex functions to pseudoconvex and quasiconvex functions are given and then used to obtain generalized optimality conditions and duality results in the presence of nonlinear equality constraints. The book has four useful self-contained appendices on vectors and matrices, topological properties of n-dimensional real space, continuity and minimization, and differentiable functions. Audience Undergraduates with an advanced calculus background and graduate students in computer science, industrial engineering, operations research, electrical engineering, economics, business, mathematics, and civil and mechanical engineering will find this book of great use. It will also be of interest to researchers in oil, investment, chemical, and software companies, as well as banks and airlines.},

Although these high numbers engender optimism that fault-tolerant quantum computing is within reach, the connection of average gate fidelity with fault-tolerance requirements is not direct. Here we use reported average gate fidelity to determine an upper bound on the quantum-gate error rate, which is the appropriate metric for assessing progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation, and we demonstrate that this bound is asymptotically tight for general noise. Although this bound is unlikely to be saturated by experimental noise, we demonstrate using explicit examples that the bound indicates a realistic deviation between the true error rate and the reported average fidelity. We introduce the Pauli distance as a measure of this deviation, and we show that knowledge of the Pauli distance enables tighter estimates of the error rate of quantum gates.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A quantum computer can solve hard problems - such as prime factoring, database searching, and quantum simulation - at the cost of needing to protect fragile quantum states from error. Quantum error correction provides this protection, by distributing a logical state among many physical qubits via quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is an appealing platform, as it allows for constructing large quantum circuits, and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits
            the surface code is a natural choice for error correction, as it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly-cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: The per-step fidelity threshold is only about $99\%$. Here, we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an average single-qubit gate fidelity of $99.92/%$ and a two-qubit gate fidelity up to $99.4\%$. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerant threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum circuits.},

However, as we will show in this paper, some general purpose methods and the ideas on which they are built can provide guidance towards the efficient solution of difficult instances. Most of this paper will be devoted to heuristic techniques applied to the problem of finding a minimum energy configuration of a cluster of atoms in R3. This is a very relevant problem with a large set of applications which has triggered considerable research efforts in the last decade. We will show how some relatively simple ideas can be used to generate fairly efficient methods which have been employed to discover many new cluster structures. In this paper we will introduce some of the main algorithmic ideas which have proven to be particularly successful in the field of global optimization applied to atomic cluster conformation problems. We will mainly discuss Basin Hopping methods, as well as their population-based variant, and some specific technique based on "direct moves". These methods, although designed for the specific problem, have a much wider applicability. In fact, one of the aims of this paper is also that of suggesting that similar ideas can be employed in order to design innovative methods even for totally different global optimization problems, like, e.g., circle packing and space trajectory planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A single-shot Toffoli, or controlled-controlled-not, gate is desirable for classical and quantum information processing. The Toffoli gate alone is universal for reversible computing and, accompanied by the Hadamard gate, forms a universal gate set for quantum computing. The Toffoli gate is also a key ingredient for (nontopological) quantum error correction. Currently Toffoli gates are achieved by decomposing into sequentially implemented single- and two-qubit gates, which require much longer times and yields lower overall fidelities compared to a single-shot implementation. We develop a quantum-control procedure to construct a single-shot Toffoli gate for three nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting transmon systems such that the fidelity is $99.9\%$ and is as fast as an entangling two-qubit gate under the same realistic conditions. The gate is achieved by a nongreedy quantum control procedure using our enhanced version of the differential evolution algorithm.},
